# REconnect User Guide

REconnect is a **desktop application for Real Estate agents to manage their work via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

<box type="info" seamless>
    If you can type fast, REconnect can get your real estate management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

<div style="page-break-before: always;"></div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed.<br>
    <box type="info" seamless>
        **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).\
        If you need help installing Java, you may find [this guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/overview-jdk-installation.html) by Oracle useful. You can navigate the sidebar of the linked page to find platform-specific instructions.
    </box>

2. Download the latest `REconnect.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for REconnect.

4. Open a command terminal:
   - **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press Enter.
   - **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` or search for "Terminal" in your Activities or Applications menu.

5. `cd` (change directory) into the folder you put the jar file in.
    <box type="tip" seamless>
        Type `cd␣` (with a space), and drag the folder into the terminal.
    </box>

6. Enter the command `java -jar REconnect.jar` to start the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. **Note:** The app contains some sample data, and it may not correspond to the data shown in the image below.<br>

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

7. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `add_client name/John Doe phone/98765432 email/johnd@example.com addr/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25` : Adds a client named `John Doe` to the client list panel.

    * `delete_property 3` : Deletes the 3rd property shown in the current property list.

    * `exit` : Exits the application.

8. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

### UX Enhancement 1: Autocompletion for all commands

REconnect provides autocompletion for all commands. This allows users to quickly find the command they want to use 
without having to remember the exact syntax. It works by typing the first few letters of the command, choosing the 
command from the dropdown list, and pressing Enter to choose it. This works for command parameters as well. This
is especially useful for long commands with many parameters, as it saves time and reduces the chance of errors.

![autocompletion](images/autoCompletion.png)

### UX Enhancement 2: Command history

REconnect keeps track of all the commands entered by the user during a session. To view this history, the cursor should
be in the 0th position of the command box. The user can then use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the 
history of commands. At most 4 commands are shown at a time in the dropdown list to prevent cluttering the command box.
This allows users to quickly re-enter previous commands without having to type them out again.

  </a>
  <figcaption>Click the image to watch a demo</figcaption>
</figure>

**Note**:
The most recent command is shown at the top of the list, and the oldest command is shown at the bottom.\
Commands that caused an error are also included in the history and appear in red.\
The command history is cleared when the application is closed.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add_client name/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_client name/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `name/NAME phone/PHONE_NUMBER`, `phone/PHONE_NUMBER name/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

REconnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

REconnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Users who know how JSON files work are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>
    If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, REConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
    Furthermore, certain edits can cause the REConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty JSON file it creates with the JSON file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: What happens to existing deals if I update a property's owner?<br>
**A**: When you update a property's owner, any existing deals involving that property will automatically have their seller updated to reflect the new owner.

**Q**: Can I bulk update multiple deals at once?<br>
**A**: No, deals must be updated individually using the `update_deal` command with the specific index of each deal.

**Q**: How are deals sorted in the deals list?<br>
**A**: Deals are displayed in the order they were created, with the oldest deals appearing first.

**Q**: Do closed deals still appear in the main list?<br>
**A**: Yes, deals of all statuses (OPEN, PENDING, CLOSED) remain visible in the main list. Use the `find_deal` command to filter by status if needed.

**Q**: If I update a client's name, will it automatically update in all related deals?<br>
**A**: Yes, updating a client's name will automatically update their name in all deals where they appear as a buyer or seller.

**Q**: Can I convert the price to a different currency?<br>
**A**: No, REconnect currently only supports prices in Singapore dollars (S$). All prices are displayed and stored in thousands of S$.

**Q**: What's the difference between using `AND_` and `OR_` in deal searches?<br>
**A**: Using `AND_` means all conditions must be met (e.g., specific buyer AND specific status), while `OR_` means any condition can be met (e.g., specific buyer OR specific status).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Emojis not being shown on Linux devices**: Emojis may not be displayed correctly on Linux devices. This is due to the default font used in JavaFX not supporting emojis.
4. **Overlapping property names or addresses**: Properties with different names but same addresses can be added, leading to potential overlaps. This will be fixed in a later release of the application.
